    <header>WHAT IS BACK END DEVELOPMENT?</header>
    <p>Back end Development refers to the server side of development where you are primarily focused on how the site works. Making updates and changes in addition to monitoring functionality of the site will be your primary responsibility. This type of web development usually consists of three parts: a server, an application, and a database. Code written by back end developers is what communicates the database information to the browser. Anything you can’t see easily with the eye such as databases and servers is the work of a back end developer.  Back end developer positions are often called programmers or web developers.</p>

   <section class="main-section" id="BACK_END_PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGES">
     <header>BACK END PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</header>
<p>Many back end developers know front end languages such as HTML and CSS but need to use languages such as Java, PHP, Ruby on Rails, Python, and .Net to get the back end job done.  Back end developers are most focused on a site’s responsiveness and speed. These languages are used to create dynamic sites which are different from static sites in that these types of websites store database information. Content on the site is constantly changing and updating. Examples of dynamic sites include Facebook, Twitter, and Google Maps.</p>

     <p>A Java developer is a back-end developer who specializes in using the Java programming language to build applications. ... developing and improving an application software. designing technical architecture. implementing software tests and debugging code. producing the design schema of a database.</p>

   <section class="main-section" id="PHP">
     <header>PHP</header>
     <p>PHP powers 78.2% of all websites whose server-side programming language we know. The language was first released in 1995 when there were few options for building dynamic websites.
     <br>
       Since PHP is dynamically typed, it means you’re able to come up with a variety of solutions and workarounds for one problem. It also means that the same bit of code can mean something different depending on the context, which makes programs written in PHP tricky to scale and sometimes slow to run.

  <section class="main-section" id="Ruby_on_Rails">
     <header>Ruby on Rails</header>
     <p>Ruby on Rails (or Ruby) is a web development language built on top of the Ruby programming language. Ruby on Rails has a set of tools that allow you to simply create basic tasks (e.g. you’re able to create a basic blog with one line of code).

<p>Ruby involves little backend work, enabling developers to create and launch applications quickly. It is similar to Python in that it’s fantastic for prototyping. Ruby grew in popularity in the early 2000s as a result but has declined since then.</p>

Ruby is open source, which means it can be modified and built upon.</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="PYTHON">
     <header>PYTHON</header>
     <p>There’s a reason Python is the fastest-growing programming language. The versatile language is used for both web and desktop development. Like with Java, there are plenty of tutorials and guides online, making it an accessible language for those just starting out.

Furthermore, its syntax is simple and easy to understand compared to other backend languages. Those who program with Python have lauded it for its “elegant,” “readable,” and “beautiful” code on Stack Overflow.</p>
   </section>
  
  <section class="main-section" id=".NET">
     <header>.NET</header>
     <p>ASP.NET is Microsoft’s answer to Sun Microsystem’s (now, Oracle) Java. The web application framework is used to build websites using languages like Visual Basic (VB), C#, F#, and more.

<p> Its MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern allows backend development duties to be handled by a controller, which interacts with a model to process data. The result is then presented to the view for display as a frontend web page.</p>

Made open source in 2016, .NET can integrate with iOS, Linux, and Android by way of .NET Core. The code is highly stable and reliable, making it a popular choice for businesses. Because it is a Microsoft product, there is great support available if you ever get lost.</p>
